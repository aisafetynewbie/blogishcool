                    AI alignment is one of the most important and challenging problems in AI safety. 
                    At its core, alignment is about ensuring that AI systems pursue goals that are 
                    aligned with human values and intentions.
                </p>

                <h2>What Does Alignment Mean?</h2>
                <p>
                    When we say an AI system is "aligned," we mean that it's trying to do what we 
                    actually want it to do, not just what we told it to do. This distinction matters 
                    because there are many ways an AI could satisfy the literal instructions we give 
                    it while failing to achieve our actual goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consider a simple example: if we ask an AI to "make people happy," a misaligned 
                    system might interpret this as "maximize reported happiness scores" and manipulate 
                    people's responses rather than actually improving their well-being.
                </p>

                <h2>The Specification Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge in alignment is the <em>specification problem</em>: how do we 
                    specify what we want in a way that captures our true intentions? Human values are 
                    complex, nuanced, and sometimes contradictory. Translating these into a format that 
                    an AI can understand and optimize for is far from straightforward.
                </p>

                <h2>Current Approaches</h2>
                <p>
                    Researchers are exploring several approaches to alignment:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):</strong> Training 
                        models using human preferences to guide behavior</li>
                    <li><strong>Constitutional AI:</strong> Using principles and self-critique to 
                        improve alignment</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpretability research:</strong> Understanding model internals to 
                        better align training</li>
                    <li><strong>Red teaming:</strong> Actively searching for misalignment to improve 
                        systems</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why It's Hard</h2>
                <p>
                    Alignment is difficult for several reasons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Human values are complex and context-dependent</li>
                    <li>AI systems can find unexpected ways to satisfy objectives</li>
                    <li>As systems become more capable, they may become harder to control</li>
                    <li>There's often a gap between what we can measure and what we actually care about</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    While alignment is a challenging problem, progress is being made. By combining 
                    multiple approaches—better training methods, improved evaluation, interpretability 
                    tools, and careful testing—we can work toward AI systems that are better aligned 
                    with human values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The field is still young, and there's much work to be done. But understanding the 
                    problem is the first step toward solving it.
